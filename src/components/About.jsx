Hi there! I&apos;m currently pursuing my BTech in CSE at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University. I&apos;m in my final year of college. Throughout my academic journey, I am constantly seeking to improve my knowledge through courses in programming languages, algorithms, and software engineering, which have equipped me with a good foundation in the field. <br></br>
<br></br>
Apart from all of this, I love to contribute in open source projects and participate in various hackathons and events. These events allow me to collaborate with other developers, share my knowledge and expertise, and work on real-world problems. In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I also value my personal interests and hobbies. Reading non-fiction books and taking walks in nature are two activities that I find both relaxing and stimulating, and I believe that they help me maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
 Overall, I am a passionate computer science student with a strong interest in development and problem solving. However, I believe that there is always more to learn and new skills to develop.<br></br> 
 <br></br>
 I am always eager to take on new challenges and push myself outside of my comfort zone. I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to grow my skillset, whether it&apos;s through personal projects or working with a team on a complex development project.
